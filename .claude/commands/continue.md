description: Continue working on the next todo item from todo.json
---

Read todo.json and find the next task where "implemented": false.

For that task:
1. Show which milestone and task you're working on
2. Implement it following the "care_about" requirements exactly
3. Create/modify the files listed in "files"
4. Write tests alongside implementation
5. Mark the task as "implemented": true when done
6. Move to the next task

Start with the first unimplemented task in milestone order.
